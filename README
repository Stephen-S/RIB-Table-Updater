This was written for a specific purpose and there are no guarantees placed on this perl script. Licenses are not a concern, but please leave the original author's name intact.

Please note that this script will consume a lot of memory depending on the RIB table size. It was not designed to be efficient but it has been validated by thorough checking.

The shell script should really be ignored, but it was added in with the perl script as a request for the specific project.
