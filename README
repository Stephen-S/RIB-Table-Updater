This was written for a specific purpose and there are no guarantees places on this perl script.

Also of importance is that this is the first perl I've really done, but I think that some may find it useful to apply updates to RIB tables in the future. Please note that this script consumes a lot of memory, but it's validity has been checked thoroughly.

The shell script should really be ignored, but it was added in with the perl script as a request.
